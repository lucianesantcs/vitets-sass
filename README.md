<h1>Vite + TS + Sass Boilerplate</h1>
<p>This is a boilerplate to create simple HTML CSS/SCSS TS pages.</p>
<h3>Before using:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If it's just a plain HTML CSS TS page, delete everything on <code>main.ts</code> file and use only the <code>index.html</code> file to structure your code.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start coding replacing div app with your HTML.
      </li>
      <li>You will have to import your <code>style.scss</code> and any other <code>.ts</code> file in the HTML</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If it's a more structured project that will use a lot of typescript, keep the structure as it is.</li>
</ul>
